# **A Scalable Framework for SOC 2 Compliance: From Startup to Enterprise**

This framework is built on four iterative phases, mirroring the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, with maturity levels that scale in complexity.    

Implementing and monitoring SOC 2 compliance is a journey that requires a structured, scalable approach. The Trust Services Criteria (TSC) provide the "what," and this framework provides the "how."     

Here you will find a comprehensive, scalable framework for implementing and monitoring SOC 2 compliance, designed to grow with an organization from its startup phase to a global enterprise.

## **Phase 1: Foundation & Scoping (The "Plan" Phase)**

This phase is about understanding what you need to protect and what you're being asked to deliver.

| Maturity Level | Activities & Considerations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Startup / Early-Stage** | **1. Management Commitment & Objective Setting:** <br> • Secure buy-in from leadership. <br> • Define the primary business driver (e.g., a key customer requirement, competitive advantage). <br> • Decide which Trust Services Categories (TSCs) to pursue (Security is mandatory; consider Availability, Confidentiality, etc.). <br><br> **2. Initial Scope Definition:** <br> • Define the "System in Scope" with clear boundaries. <br> • **Startup Focus:** Keep it simple. Scope a single, core product/service and the essential infrastructure supporting it (e.g., AWS/Azure environment, key SaaS apps). Avoid including complex, legacy, or non-critical systems. |
| **Growth / Mid-Market** | **1. Formalize Governance:** <br> • Establish a formal cross-functional compliance team with a designated lead. <br> • Integrate compliance objectives into corporate goals. <br><br> **2. Refine Scope & Identify Key Dependencies:** <br> • Re-evaluate scope as new products/services are launched. <br> • Formally identify and document all **Subservice Organizations** (e.g., AWS, Datadog, payroll providers) and map data flows. |
| **Global Enterprise** | **1. Centralized Governance & Federated Model:** <br> • Establish a Central Compliance Office to set global policy. <br> • Implement a federated model with compliance champions in each business unit/region. <br><br> **2. Complex Scoping & Segmentation:** <br> • Manage multiple SOC 2 reports for different business units or services. <br> • Implement sophisticated system boundary definitions to avoid scope creep and manage cost. |

## **Phase 2: Implementation & Gap Remediation (The "Do" Phase)**

This is where you build and document your control environment.

| Maturity Level | Activities & Considerations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Startup / Early-Stage** | **1. Leverage Your Cloud Providers:** <br> • Heavily rely on the shared responsibility model. Use built-in security controls (AWS IAM, Azure Security Center, GCP IAM). <br> • This is your most efficient path to compliance. <br><br> **2. Implement "Good Hygiene" Controls:** <br> • **CC6.1/6.2:** Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all admin accounts. Implement role-based access control (RBAC). <br> • **CC7.1/7.2:** Enable cloud provider logging and monitoring. Perform basic vulnerability scans. <br> • **CC8.1:** Implement a simple, documented change management process (even if it's a GitHub PR process). <br> • **CC1.1:** Draft and communicate a basic Code of Conduct and Information Security Policy. |
| **Growth / Mid-Market** | **1. Formalize Control Activities:** <br> • **CC3.2:** Establish a formal, documented risk assessment process. <br> • **CC4.1:** Implement a schedule for internal control reviews (e.g., quarterly user access reviews). <br> • **CC9.2:** Develop a formal vendor risk management program to assess critical suppliers. <br><br> **2. Automate Where Possible:** <br> • Use tools to automate user provisioning/deprovisioning (e.g., SCIM with Okta). <br> • Implement automated compliance scanning (e.g., CSPM tools, IaC scanning). |
| **Global Enterprise** | **1. Advanced Control Maturity & Automation:** <br> • Implement a GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) platform to manage policies, controls, risks, and evidence. <br> • Deploy a SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management) for centralized log analysis and proactive threat detection (**CC7.2**). <br> • Use SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) for automated incident response (**CCT.4**). <br><br> **2. Standardize and Scale Processes:** <br> • Develop global standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all control activities, with regional adaptations as needed. <br> • Integrate compliance requirements into the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) and procurement processes. |

## **Phase 3: Monitoring & Evidence Collection (The "Check" Phase)**

This phase ensures your controls are operating effectively over time.

| Maturity Level | Activities & Considerations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Startup / Early-Stage** | **1. Manual & Periodic Checks:** <br> • **CC4.1:** Perform manual, quarterly user access reviews. <br> • **CC7.1:** Manually review cloud security logs and vulnerability scan reports monthly. <br> • Collect screenshots and system-generated reports as evidence. <br><br> **2. Simple Ticketing & Tracking:** <br> • Use a simple spreadsheet or a basic project management tool (Jira, Asana) to track control monitoring tasks and evidence collection. |
| **Growth / Mid-Market** | **1. Introduce Tooling & Regular Cadence:** <br> • Use a dedicated compliance platform (like Vanta, Drata, SecureFrame) to automate evidence collection from integrated systems. <br> • Establish a formal monthly control monitoring cadence led by the compliance team. <br><br> **2. Internal Audits:** <br> • Conduct formal internal audits semi-annually to test control operation before the external audit. |
| **Global Enterprise** | **1. Continuous Control Monitoring (CCM):** <br> • Implement a CCM program using the GRC and SIEM to monitor control effectiveness in near real-time. Alerts are generated for control failures. <br> • **CC4.1:** Move from periodic to continuous monitoring for key controls. <br><br> **2. Centralized Evidence Repository:** <br> • The GRC platform serves as a single source of truth for all control evidence, audit reports, and management assertions. <br> • Automated reporting for management and the board. |

## **Phase 4: Audit, Reporting & Continuous Improvement (The "Act" Phase)**

This is the culmination of your efforts and the launchpad for ongoing maturity.

| Maturity Level | Activities & Considerations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Startup / Early-Stage** | **1. First SOC 2 Type I Audit:** <br> • Begin with a **Type I** report. It's less expensive and demonstrates your controls are *suitably designed* at a point in time. <br> • Select an auditor experienced with startups and cloud-native environments. <br> • Use the audit process as a learning experience to strengthen your program. |
| **Growth / Mid-Market** | **1. Move to SOC 2 Type II:** <br> • Graduate to a **Type II** report, which provides a much higher level of assurance by verifying that controls operated effectively over a period (typically 6-12 months). <br> • Use the auditor's opinion and management letter (which details noted deficiencies) as a blueprint for improvement. |
| **Global Enterprise** | **1. Streamlined Audits & Integrated Reporting:** <br> • Conduct multiple, concurrent audits (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.) with a unified control set to maximize efficiency. <br> • Issue SOC 2 reports on a rolling basis for different business units. <br> • Use the **SOC 3** report for general marketing purposes, as it is a public, summary-level report. <br><br> **2. Strategic Continuous Improvement:** <br> • Integrate findings from SOC 2, internal audits, and risk assessments into the strategic planning and budgeting process. <br> • Proactively adapt the control environment to address emerging threats and new technologies. |

## **Cross-Cutting Principles for All Maturity Levels**

1.  **Culture of Security:** Compliance is not just an IT function. It requires a company-wide culture of security and privacy, driven from the top (**CC1.1**).
2.  **Documentation is Key:** If it's not documented, it didn't happen. Maintain clear, accessible, and version-controlled policies, procedures, and records of control activities.
3.  **Leverage Technology:** At every stage, use technology to reduce manual effort, from cloud-native security tools for startups to enterprise GRC platforms for global companies.
4.  **The "Points of Focus" are Your Guide:** The Points of Focus in the TSC are not mandatory, but they are an excellent checklist to ensure you haven't missed a critical aspect of a criterion.
5.  **Start Small, Think Big:** It's better to have a narrow scope and a clean report than a broad scope with significant exceptions. You can always expand the scope in subsequent years.

By following this phased, maturity-based framework, organizations of any size can systematically build, operate, monitor, and improve a robust SOC 2 compliance program that earns customer trust and scales with their business.
